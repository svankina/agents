# Agents

This repository installs OMP instructions and resources. It also preserves historical Pi and Claude skills, prompts, extensions, and commands without installing them.

## Repository layout

- `omp/AGENTS.md` — direct OMP standing instructions and user facts.
- `home/AGENTS.md` — home project context.
- `shared/skills/`, `shared/commands/`, `shared/agents/` — resources installed into OMP.
- `bin/` — executable helpers installed into `~/.local/bin`.
- `pi/extensions/` — historical Pi coding-agent extensions. See [`pi/extensions/README.md`](pi/extensions/README.md).
- `pi/prompts/`, `pi/skills/`, `claude/commands/` — preserved historical resources, not installer targets.
- `omp/extensions/` — standalone OMP extensions; `omp/lib/` contains their shared implementations.

## Configuration

Machine-specific paths and URLs are not hardcoded. Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` (gitignored) and fill in values for your machine; prompts and skills reference these as `$VARS`.

## Default context

`omp/AGENTS.md` is the single direct source for OMP standing instructions and
user facts. Detailed procedures live in
[`docs/agent-workflows.md`](docs/agent-workflows.md) and
[`docs/machine-operations.md`](docs/machine-operations.md), not in every prompt.

## Install OMP resources

Run `bin/omp-install` (or `bin/omp-install install`), then
`bin/omp-install check`. The CLI uses only Python's standard library.
The repository defaults to the executable's resolved location; use
`--repo PATH` and `--home PATH` to select another checkout or home directory.

| Source | Installed link |
| --- | --- |
| `omp/AGENTS.md` | `~/.omp/agent/AGENTS.md` |
| `home/AGENTS.md` | `~/AGENTS.md` |
| `shared/skills/` child directories | `~/.omp/agent/skills/` children |
| `shared/commands/*.md` | `~/.omp/agent/commands/` children |
| `shared/agents/*.md` | `~/.omp/agent/agents/` children |
| Executable non-`.py` files in `bin/` | `~/.local/bin/` children |

Edits to linked sources take effect without generation. Run the installer
after adding resources. It leaves correct links unchanged and installs missing
ones. Incorrect links pointing lexically inside the repository may be replaced.
Foreign files, directories, or links block installation with exit code 2;
the whole plan is checked before any changes. Missing required instruction
sources also block installation.

`check` never mutates: exit code 0 means clean, and 1 means drift.
Only dangling links pointing within the corresponding source subtree are pruned
from OMP resource directories and `~/.local/bin`; foreign links are preserved.
The installer does not manage OMP configuration, `managed-skills`, extensions,
or other harness directories, and does not install a `CLAUDE.md` alias.
Historical design and plan documents describe past systems, not this contract.

## Herd question answers

`omp/extensions/herd-questions.ts` provides the `ask` tool through OMP's public
extension API. It supports terminal selection and direct answers from Herd's
Android app. It does not patch or replace the OMP executable.

Add `~/src/agents/omp/extensions` to the `extensions` list in OMP's config.
The workstation already uses this directory. New processes load the extension;
existing sessions are not restarted or modified.

The plugin creates a private same-user Unix socket under
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/omp-questions`, or `/tmp/omp-questions-<UID>`.
Herd binds answers to the exact process, transcript, tool call, and request.
Single-choice, multiple-choice, and custom answers are supported.
Expired and duplicate replies are rejected. Normal terminal selection remains
available if the socket cannot start.

The plugin uses the configured `ask.timeout`. Public extension APIs do not
expose plan-mode state, so plan mode does not disable that timeout.
Set `ask.timeout` to `0` to require an explicit answer in every mode.
It does not use OMP's private speech vocalizer.

The same socket exposes `GET /models` and `POST /model` for the interactive
OMP session only. The catalog comes from `ctx.models.list()` and identifies
models by both provider and id. A switch requires the exact absolute session
file reference, an idle session with no queued messages or pending questions,
and available authentication. Competing switches, stale references and busy
sessions receive HTTP 409; unavailable models receive 400, and unavailable
control/authentication receives 503. Success is confirmed against the live
session model after the public `pi.setModel()` call.

The bridge rechecks session identity and idle state around asynchronous work.
OMP's public setter also performs asynchronous authentication internally and
offers no atomic idle/session guard: a terminal action during that internal
await can still race the mutation. A detected race returns an error without
retrying or rolling back against a potentially different session. Source
changes take effect in newly launched OMP processes, not already-loaded
extension instances; no OMP core files need editing.

## Peer message display

`omp/extensions/peers.ts` renders cross-process communication with a
sender-to-recipient heading and the full message body. Peer names come from
discovery. Short instance IDs distinguish sessions with the same name.

Delivery status is separate from the message. A delivery receipt does not mean
the peer completed its work. Reply timeouts and delivery errors remain visible.
Expand the entry to inspect full routing addresses and thread IDs.
Agent-facing protocol instructions and JSON remain unchanged.

The configured extension directory loads this display in new OMP processes.
Already-running processes retain their loaded extension.

## Historical Pi source checkouts

- Primary local Pi resource checkout: `~/src/pagent`
- Active project-local Pi skills there: `~/src/pagent/.pi/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- Packaged browser-harness skill: `~/src/pagent/extensions/browser-harness/SKILL.md`
- Packaged pisaddle skill mirror: `~/src/pagent/extensions/pisaddle/.pi/skills/claude-saddle/SKILL.md`
